## Project overview
Statistical arbitrage / Pairs Trading (Kalman filter, cointegration) — a hands-on pairs trading repo that covers cointegration tests, spread modelling and backtests. This demonstrates statistical methods, mean reversion ideas, and risk neutral strategies you can adapt to futures spreads.

The repository includes:
- Colab-ready notebook that downloads Indian equity prices (yfinance) with synthetic fallback
- Engle–Granger cointegration test and hedge ratio estimation (OLS)
- Z-score spread modelling and signal generation
- Backtester (daily mark-to-market, transaction costs, slippage)
- Example Kalman filter implementation (optional extension)
- Export of trade logs and summary CSVs
